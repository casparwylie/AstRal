# Astral
Augmented reality social network

Astral is an app that  aims to change the way we can see information. Of course, data is everywhere and very easy to access - however it is often out of context. 
The key idea behind Astral is to allow people to see location bound information with the effect of augmented reality. This  means a user can place a virtual signpost (or 'focal'), write a message on it, and put it anywhere in the real world. Other users can then walk down any street, hold up their phone, and see these virtual signposts as part of their camera view - as if the signposts are actually in front of them.

This allows for many new ideas in advertising, communication, reviewing, tourism, and much more. Users are able to comment on these signposts, and more importantly, any user can post anything within reason. From humorous comments regarding their surroundings, to formal reviews on a cafes door steps, this app opens up a virtual social under world to our streets.
